# Solidifying my learnings 

I am currently learning Dart and cementing my learning through the usage of flash cards. I have an app and also using paper to track the progress. 

I also want to play around with some Dart code, so I can create and then later come back to it and make it better. I am hoping to cement my learnings better!

## What's happening here? 

I have two lists in the `QnAs.dart` file, and the for loop in the `main.dart` is what iterates over both of the lists. It's super simple because the index of the question and answers are in the same position. (I don't have a better way to do this just yet)

Wanting to gamify it a bit more, I created some basic logic to check the score and then return results back the the terminal.
